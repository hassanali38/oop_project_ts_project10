# oop_project_ts_project10

A simple and interactive command-line application built with TypeScript that demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows users to "talk" to themselves or interact with students. Users can add new students by name and check if a student already exists in the list. The program uses Inquirer for user prompts and provides a friendly and engaging way to manage and interact with a list of students.

## Features

- **Self Interaction**: Users can choose to talk to themselves and receive a motivational message.
- **Student Interaction**: Users can add students by name and interact with them if they already exist in the list.
- **Dynamic List Management**: Automatically adds new students and maintains an updated list of students.

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-interaction-cli.git

## Example
```bash
Welcome to My Application!
? To whom do you want to talk? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Self 
  Student 
  Quit 
```
If you choose "Student":
```bash
? Enter the name of a student to whom you want to talk: John
Hello! I am John and I am fine!
```

If you choose "Self:"
```bash
I am talking to myself!
I am feeling very motivated right now!
```
